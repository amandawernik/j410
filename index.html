    <div class="text">On February 7th, 2020, I enter the San Luis Obispo Tribune office space to meet up with Cal Poly journalism alumni who are now employed there. I am greeted with grins and friendly faces, contrary to the stereotype that newsrooms are cold and hostile environments.

    <div class="text">Katlyn Leslie graduated from Cal Poly with a Journalism degree in 2013. During her time in college, she started out by working on the Mustang Daily (now Mustang News). She then pursued an internship at the Tribune in her winter quarter of senior year. She lucked out when they had a job opening as a part time news assistant, and then worked her way up to a reporter position two years later. </div>

    <div class="text">“I grew up in the military so we moved around a lot so I never had that sense of connectedness. I always knew that what I wanted was to have a place in a community,” Leslie shares, “When you’re college you want to be a big star reporter. You want to report national news at one of the big papers. But I really feel like the future of journalism is in community news- in telling the stories of the people in an area.”</div>

    <div class="text">Leslie feels that the Cal Poly Journalism major has sufficiently prepared her for her career, and says she even refers to her old class notes sometimes. She encourages Cal Poly Journalism majors to get involved, whether that be with the school radio station or newspaper.</div>

    <div class="text">Stephanie Finucane graduated from Cal Poly in 1980 with a degree in journalism and a concentration in agriculture. She started off doing an internship at Lumix Feed, then became an editorial assistant in Oregon, worked at Santa Maria Times, was a reporter at Santa Barbara News Press and finally became a reporter at the Tribune in 2000. She then worked her up to an assistant opinion editor position, the job she currently holds.</div>

    <div class="text">“This job is challenging in that I write about an array of subjects, while reporters maybe cover two or three different topics. You kind of have to know a bit about everything going on in the county. It’s also really interesting because you get to write about a lot of different things,” says Finucane.</div>

    <div class="text">“We’re fulfilling a role in the community that’s more important now than it ever has been,” Tarica asserts, “Being able to tell stories, go out and communicate with our readership, track our local governments- and trying to do all the functions that the American press is expected to do. All of that is the same as it has been throughout my career.”</div>
